# 👋 Hi, I’m @apincsak7

## 👀 I’m interested in...
I’m passionate about **data analytics**, **data science**, and **machine learning**, particularly how data-driven decisions can enhance business processes and outcomes. With significant domain knowledge in **healthcare** and **pharmaceuticals**, 
I am transitioning to working with data in a more technical capacity. 

Currently, I am focusing on building a strong foundation with **SQL**, **Python**, and **Excel**. Once I’ve mastered these core skills through both self-study and my formal Master’s program, 
I plan to explore data visualization projects and other advanced topics. Instead of sharing academic assignments, I prefer to post projects driven by my own curiosity and passion for learning.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning...
I’m actively working on strengthening my data analysis capabilities, with a focus on:
- **SQL** for data manipulation and querying (my primary focus at the moment)
- **Python** (specifically Pandas and Matplotlib) for data processing and visualization
- **Excel** for data cleaning, reporting, and building dashboards
- **Machine Learning** fundamentals, including supervised learning models and their applications

In my full-time role, I frequently use **SQL**, **Tableau**, and **Swagger**. However, I’m eager to expand my skill set and dive deeper into areas that fuel my curiosity and professional growth.


## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...
Open-source projects, Kaggle competitions, or any opportunities where I can contribute to data analysis, visualization, or machine learning. I'm always eager to learn from others and share insights!!

## 📫 How to reach me...
